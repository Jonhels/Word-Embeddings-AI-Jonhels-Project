# Word-Embeddings-AI-Jonhels-Project
Learning to work with AI and understand word embeddings

This is my start on AI, I do this to be a more attractive developer for future workplaces. I find it important to show that I am actively trying to learn the latest tech. At this point in my career I need to show that I not only want to learn, but also how I do learn.

In my github issues I have added steps for my learning process, in there I have created issues on the articles I need to read and videoes I need to watch to be a better developer.

Ah yeah, btw the issues for learning is marked with numbers because they have to be read and watched in chronological order
